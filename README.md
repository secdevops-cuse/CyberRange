## Domains of knowledge
This open-source research lab provides a bootstrap learning platform for 
Technologists studying any one of the "Big-3" technology skills.  

1. Cyber Security
2. Cloud Computing
3. DevOps
 
This project supports 7 gigantically broad domains of technical knowledge.

1. Offensive Security
2. SecDevOps
3. Architecture & Engineering
4. Vulnerability, Change, & Configuration Management
5. Quality Assurance
6. Auditing - Processing, Systems, Applications
7. Development - Infrastructure / Web Applications

# Mission Statement
 
The ultimate expectation is to emulate the quality, format, and presentation of 
the [Syracuse University Cyber SEED Labs](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/Labs_16.04/) while 
creating strategic hubs of Cyber Security Center-of-Excellence Partnerships where the gap
between enterprise experience & academic learning is addressed by focusing training paths on 
people, products, and process.
